# How to Distribute Your App Binary (.apk) with Android Studio

## 1. Prepare Your App for Release

- **Update app version:**  
  Edit `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts` to reflect your release version.

- **Remove debug code:**  
  Make sure no debug logs or test code are present in your release build.

- **Check permissions:**  
  Review `AndroidManifest.xml` for only necessary permissions.

## 2. Build a Signed APK

1. **Open your project in Android Studio.**

2. **Go to the menu:**  
   `Build` → `Generate Signed Bundle / APK...`

3. **Choose APK:**  
   Select `APK` and click `Next`.

4. **Create or select a keystore:**

  > **What is a keystore?**  
  > A keystore is a secure file (`.jks`) that stores cryptographic keys used to sign your app. Signing your APK proves its authenticity and integrity to Android devices and app stores.
  >
  > **How does it work?**  
  > When you sign your app, Android Studio uses the private key from your keystore to generate a digital signature. Devices and app stores use the corresponding public key to verify that the APK hasn’t been tampered with and that it comes from you.
  >
  > **Why is it important?**  
  > - Required for publishing on Google Play and installing on most devices.  
  > - Ensures only you can update your app (you must use the same keystore for all future updates).  
  > - Losing your keystore means you cannot update your app in the future.

  - If you don’t have a keystore, click `Create new...` and fill in the details (save the `.jks` file and passwords securely!).
  - If you have one, browse and select it, then enter the password, alias, and key password.

5. **Select build variant:**  
   Choose `release` (not `debug`).

6. **Signature versions:**  
   Check both `V1 (Jar Signature)` and `V2 (Full APK Signature)` for best compatibility.

7. **Finish:**  
   Click `Finish` and wait for the build to complete.

## 3. Locate the APK

- After the build, Android Studio will show a notification with a link to the APK location.
- By default, it’s in:  
  `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## 4. Distribute the APK

- **Direct sharing:**  
  You can now send this APK file directly to users (email, website, etc.).
- **Install on device:**  
  Users must enable “Install from unknown sources” on their Android device to install the APK.
- **Google Play:**  
  If you want to publish on Google Play, use the “Generate Signed Bundle / APK...” process but select “Android App Bundle” instead of APK, and follow the Play Console upload instructions.

# iOS Binary Distribution with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

> **Note:** While traditional iOS app distribution requires Xcode on macOS, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) allows you to share code between Android and iOS. However, generating a distributable iOS binary (`.ipa`) still has limitations on Windows.

## What You Can Do with KMP on Windows

- **Develop shared logic:**  
  Use Kotlin Multiplatform to write and test shared code for Android and iOS in Android Studio on Windows.
- **Build iOS frameworks:**  
  You can generate iOS frameworks (`.framework` files) from Windows using Gradle tasks, which can later be integrated into an Xcode project.

## What You *Cannot* Do on Windows

- **No direct `.ipa` generation:**  
  You cannot build or sign a complete iOS app binary (`.ipa`) for distribution from Windows. Apple’s toolchain (Xcode, codesign, etc.) is required for final packaging and signing, and these tools only run on macOS.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Develop shared code in Android Studio with KMP.**
2. **Generate iOS framework:**  
   Run Gradle tasks (e.g., `assembleXCFramework`) to produce a framework for iOS.
3. **Transfer to macOS:**  
   Move the generated framework to a Mac.
4. **Integrate with Xcode:**  
   Use Xcode to create the iOS app, link the framework, and archive/export the `.ipa` for distribution.

## Alternatives

- **Cloud macOS services:**  
  Use services like MacStadium, MacInCloud, or GitHub Actions with macOS runners to automate iOS builds and distribution remotely.
- **Cross-platform frameworks:**  
  Consider Flutter or React Native, which offer some tooling for iOS builds, but final signing and distribution still require macOS.

> **Summary:**  
> You can develop and test shared code for iOS on Windows with Kotlin Multiplatform, but you still need access to a Mac to generate and distribute an iOS app binary.

# Summary

- Use Android Studio’s “Generate Signed APK” wizard for Android distribution.
- Share the resulting APK file directly or upload to Google Play.
- iOS distribution requires a different toolchain (Xcode) and process.
